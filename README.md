# Flutter-code
These are some mobile app examples using Flutter for CET373 - Mobile Technologies

## The content of the repo is as follows:
- <ins>Dummy_code</ins>: This code shows the module title (CET373 - Mobile Technologies) as a text across platforms. It is for demonstration in the first lecture session (also shown in the first lecture slides).

- <ins>Simple_scaffold_desgin</ins>: This a simple layout design containing a header and body with text, shape/padding, icon, images obtained from network, and a colour background. It also includes a [commended] table feature for the students to build one in their workshop. Students can use this example to make a different layout from the worksheet. This example is for demonstration in the second lecture session.

- <ins>Icons_and_Text_Tabs+Image_Control</ins>: This application has tabs for text, icons, and images for the University of Sunderland. This application allows students to navigate within the same pages using tabs. This example can be demonstrated in the third lecture session.

- <ins>Routing_Navigation_Gestures</ins>: Unlike the previous application, this one allows students to navigate to different elements [Drawer Navigation, Stack Navigation, Tabs, and Dialog] by opening new pages. Additionally, it included gestures such as pop-up windows and responding to them. This example can be demonstrated in the fourth lecture session.

- <ins>ReadWrite [In development]</ins>: This example somehow works on Linux, but does not work on Windows due to admin permission required, and it crashes on Edge. I could not get it right, but it is a feature that students must use in their assignments. It can be demonstrated in an extra session.
